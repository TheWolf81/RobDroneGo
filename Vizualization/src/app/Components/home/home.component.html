<h1>Welcome to RobDroneGo</h1>

<h2>What is RobDroneGo?</h2>
<p>RobDroneGo is a web solution, developed by 3rd year Informatics Engeneering students in ISEP, based in NodeJS, Angular and other technologies.</p>
<p>It came to life with the purpose of aiding the newly acquired fleet of Robots and Drones</p>
<br>
<h2>What can RobDroneGo do?</h2>
<p>RobDroneGo can help you manage your fleet of Robots and Drones, by providing a web interface where you can manage ISEP's Campus data, Robot data, and request tasks for the robots to perform.</p>
<p>It also provides a way to visualize, in 3D, some of the Campus' components, such as building floors and even control a robot within the premises.</p>
<p>The features available to you depend on your role, whether you are a student, a campus manager, a fleet manager, an administrator or a task manager</p>
